# Pollution-LSTM
## Predicting next day pollution(PM) based on last 30 days data as input in budateteny city
In this project, I used LSTM-encoder/decoder algorithm to find the pollution of a city with help of the open source dataset.
The dataset contains pollution data and its depending factors for many cities. I used to predict the next day pollution of the city budateteny by using past 30 days data.
